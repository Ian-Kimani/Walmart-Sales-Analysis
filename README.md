#  Walmart Sales Analysis  

This project is all about exploring and analyzing Walmart sales data.  
This is the full workflow:  

1. **Cleaned the raw dataset** using Python (pandas).  
2. **Saved the cleaned dataset** for later use.  
3. **Imported it into PostgreSQL** using SQLAlchemy.  
4. **Wrote SQL queries** to analyze sales performance.  
5. **Documented the process** with notes and screenshots in Word.  
6. **Built a dashboard in Excel** to visualize the insights.

## What I Did  

- **Data Cleaning (Python + Pandas):**  
  - Handled missing values, corrected data types, and saved a new file: `Cleaned_Walmart_Sales.csv`.  

- **Database Work (PostgreSQL):**  
  - Imported the cleaned dataset into a PostgreSQL database.  
  - Wrote SQL queries to answer questions like:  
    - Which stores had the highest total sales?  
    - What were the average weekly sales per department?  
    - How did sales change over time?  

- **Documentation:**  
  - Took screenshots of queries + results.  
  - Created a Word document as reference material.  

- **Dashboard (Excel):**  
  - Used pivot tables and charts to create a sales dashboard.  
  - Summarized key metrics and trends.
